In twilight's gentle, fading hue,    
The stars emerge, a celestial crew.    
They twinkle brightly, far and wide,    
As night unfolds its quiet tide.    
The moon, a silver, glowing sphere,    
Whispers secrets in the ear,    
Of lovers dreaming, hearts aglow,    
In this tranquil, night's soft flow.    
Nature's lullaby, a soothing rhyme,    
In the stillness of this precious time.
