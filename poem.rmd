## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
’Twas brillig, and the slithy toves    
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:    
All mimsy were the borogoves,    
And the mome raths outgrabe.    
“Beware the Jabberwock, my son!  

## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
My long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree  
Toward heaven still,  
And there's a barrel that I didn't fill  
Beside it, and there may be two or three  
Apples I didn't pick upon some bough. 

## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
"The sun was shining on the sea,    
      Shining with all his might:    
He did his very best to make    
      The billows smooth and bright —    
And this was odd, because it was    
      The middle of the night.    

The moon was shining sulkily,    
      Because she thought the sun    
Had got no business to be there    
      After the day was done —    
"It's very rude of him," she said,      
      "To come and spoil the fun."  

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem you created using chatGPT of 20 to 30 lines,here!-->
Beneath the canvas of the sapphire sky,  
Where golden sunsets and eagles fly,  
A world of wonder, nature's grand design,  
In every detail, a story to define.  

Mountains rise with ancient, stoic grace,  
Their rugged peaks, a sacred hiding place,  
Valleys cradle rivers' endless song,  
As time and nature dance along.  

Forests lush in green, a tranquil maze,  
Where sunlight filters through a leafy haze,  
Inhaling the scent of earth and pine,  
A moment of peace, a glimpse divine.  

The ocean's waves, a symphony of sound,  
In ceaseless rhythm, they abound,  
Salt-kissed breezes, waves upon the shore,  
A timeless beauty to forever explore.  

Amidst this world, so vast and wide,  
Adventures waiting, dreams to ride,  
For in nature's embrace, we find our home,  
A place of solace, where hearts can roam.  

From dawn to dusk, and through the night,  
Nature's wonders fill us with delight,  
In this precious world, we are blessed to be,  
Guardians of its beauty, for all to see.
